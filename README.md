# Constitutional Courier

**Constitutional Courier** is a modern desktop application designed to provide an elegant and intuitive way to explore the United States Constitution. Built with Python and PyQt5, it offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to read, search, and navigate through constitutional texts seamlessly. All offline and simple. This is a derivitive of my GTK app which is much prettier https://github.com/moontowncitizen/constitutional_courier
